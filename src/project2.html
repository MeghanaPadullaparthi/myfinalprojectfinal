          <p>
          <p>1.Communication: </p>
          <p> First texting is completely insecure a normal SMS messages are the absolute worst. Most alternatives out there like Facebook messenger aren't much better at keeping your data secure and they might actually be worse so the best thing to do is to either only use iMessage which only works on Apple devices, or switch over to signal, signals is the most secure messenger you're going to find out there
            it's open sourced everything on there is fully encrypted and you can make sure only you and the person you're texting can view your messages, no one else can, if you have an Android device you can also set it as your default SMS app. In iPhone obviously you're not being able to do that because Apple doesn't offer that functionality but you can still install the app and run it separate from your messages </p>
          <p>2.Email:</p>
          <p> Most email providers out there completely invade all of your emails sent back and forth. Protonmail, is end-to-end encrypted so it is the safest email to use. The easiest way to switch email providers is:</p>
          <p> -	forward emails to new services </p>
          <p> -	modify websites to use new email</p>
          <p> -	after a few months you will notice how you get no emails to your account</p>
          <p> -	delete your old email</p>
          <p> 3.Smartphone: </p>
          <p> if you're getting a brand-new iPhone out of box and you're getting a brand-new and your device out of the box the iPhone is most likely going to be the more secure device lots of Android devices don't get continuous security updates and it's currently much easier to infiltrate a majority of Android devices in comparison to I phones the main exception to this is if you have a stock Android device or an Android device close to stock which frequently gets updates.</p>
          <p>  4.Storage:</p>
          <p>You need to periodically wipe your hard drives free space using a tool Exede cleaner to make sure you can't recover those files need
            to leave in another extremely part of storage is encryption you should be using drive encryption such as BitLocker on windows or file Locker for Mac's never ever remove your encryption on Android devices if you're given the option to do so.</p>
          <p>5.Passwords:
          <p> Passwords part two this one's super easy guys don't use any form of protection on your computer or mobile devices that isn't a traditional password nothing biometric no pins nothing voice-activated nothing fingerprint activated don't use any of that another overlooked device people don't tend to look at is your router make sure you're not using a default password on your router and you have a password generated by your password manager bonus points if you hide the SSID so you can't visually see the router on your devices you have to input the name of the router manually. </p>
          <p> 6.Web browser:</p>
          <p> You should avoid Chrome or any chromium based browsers since Google is very well known to collect all your data. Try to stick with Firefox or any other privacy base browse. Extension wise make sure you have block origin of privacy oriented ad blocker privacy badger a tracker blocker and HTTPS Everywhere to keep you using HTTPS rather than HTTP. In addition make sure flash and JavaScript are completely disabled inside of your browser.</p>
