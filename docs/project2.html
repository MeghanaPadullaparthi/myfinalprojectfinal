                                <p>1.Communication:</p>
                                <p>First texting is completely insecure a normal SMS messages are the absolute
                                    worst. Most alternatives out there like Facebook messenger aren't much
                                    better at keeping your data secure and they might actually be worse so
                                    the best thing to do is to either only use iMessage which only works on
                                    Apple devices, or switch over to signal, signals is the most secure messenger
                                    you're going to find out there it's open sourced everything on there is
                                    fully encrypted and you can make sure only you and the person you're texting
                                    can view your messages, no one else can, if you have an Android device
                                    you can also set it as your default SMS app. In iPhone obviously you're
                                    not being able to do that because Apple doesn't offer that functionality
                                    but you can still install the app and run it separate from your messages</p>
                                <p>2.Email:</p>
                                <p>Most email providers out there completely invade all of your emails sent
                                    back and forth. Protonmail, is end-to-end encrypted so it is the safest
                                    email to use. The easiest way to switch email providers is:</p>
                                <p>- forward emails to new services</p>
                                <p>- modify websites to use new email</p>
                                <p>- after a few months you will notice how you get no emails to your account</p>
                                <p>- delete your old email</p>
                                <p>3.Smartphone:</p>
                                <p>if you're getting a brand-new iPhone out of box and you're getting a brand-new
                                    and your device out of the box the iPhone is most likely going to be the
                                    more secure device lots of Android devices don't get continuous security
                                    updates and it's currently much easier to infiltrate a majority of Android
                                    devices in comparison to I phones the main exception to this is if you
                                    have a stock Android device or an Android device close to stock which frequently
                                    gets updates.</p>
                                <p>4.Storage:</p>
                                <p>You need to periodically wipe your hard drives free space using a tool
                                    Exede cleaner to make sure you can't recover those files need to leave
                                    in another extremely part of storage is encryption you should be using
                                    drive encryption such as BitLocker on windows or file Locker for Mac's
                                    never ever remove your encryption on Android devices if you're given the
                                    option to do so.</p>
                                <p>5.Passwords:
                                    <p>Passwords part two this one's super easy guys don't use any form of protection
                                        on your computer or mobile devices that isn't a traditional password nothing
                                        biometric no pins nothing voice-activated nothing fingerprint activated
                                        don't use any of that another overlooked device people don't tend to look
                                        at is your router make sure you're not using a default password on your
                                        router and you have a password generated by your password manager bonus
                                        points if you hide the SSID so you can't visually see the router on your
                                        devices you have to input the name of the router manually.</p>
                                    <p>6.Web browser:</p>
                                    <p>You should avoid Chrome or any chromium based browsers since Google is
                                        very well known to collect all your data. Try to stick with Firefox or
                                        any other privacy base browse. Extension wise make sure you have block
                                        origin of privacy oriented ad blocker privacy badger a tracker blocker
                                        and HTTPS Everywhere to keep you using HTTPS rather than HTTP. In addition
                                        make sure flash and JavaScript are completely disabled inside of your browser.</p>
